## Usage

So let's start with how to run my program. Okay, first we should go into our code space and open a terminal. Make sure you are in the correct directory; otherwise, we won’t be able to open the correct file. Now we should type in our terminal “python app.py” and hit enter. In the terminal, you should see some lines of text. Look for a URL, hover over it, and click on it. It will then redirect you to a page that looks like this.
